Setting up
----------

Setting up gitolite after rpm-install can be done as follows.

On the server:

0)  copy your admin user's ssh public key to /tmp/foo.pub
     (change foo to your username)

1)  run "su - gitolite3" to get a login shell on the gitolite user

2)  run "cp /tmp/foo.pub ." (change foo to your username)

3)  run "gitolite setup -pk ~/foo.pub" 

4)  all done, exit the gitolite3 user shelll (CTRL+D).

On whatever machine your key came from (maybe your
workstation or another account on the same server):

5)  run "git clone gitolite3@<name.or.ip>:gitolite-admin" to
    start adding users and repos.

To upgrade from a pre 3.0 release, read:

Your setup might be more complex than mine was and thus require more care
and customization, backup everything before you start!

The process I followed on my installation was as follows:

1. su - gitolite
2. git clone repositories/gitolite-admin.git
3. su to root
4. yum remove gitolite  : this will preserve your old .ssh/authorized keys.
5. su - gitolite
6. mv .gitolite.rc .gitolite.rc-old
7. rm -rf repositories/gitolite-admin.git
8. Checked documentation to make sure I didn't need to preset the new .rc. 
I didn't, I have a very simple configuration.
9. su to root
10. yum install gitolite3
11. su - gitolite3
12. gitolite setup -a admin
13. cd to your gitolite admin
14. gitolite push -f

At this point, everything worked as expected.

Quick Notes for admin operations
--------------------------------

To administer gitolite, make changes to the config file
(conf/gitolite.conf) and/or the pubkeys (in subdirectory
'keydir') in any gitolite-admin clone, then git add, git commit, and git
push.

ADDING REPOS: Do NOT add repos manually on the server.  Edit
the config file to give *some* user access to the repo.
When you push, an empty repo will be created on the server.

ADDING USERS: copy their pubkey as keydir/<username>.pub,
add it, commit and push.
